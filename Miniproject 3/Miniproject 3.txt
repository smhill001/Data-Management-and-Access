Great job on project 2!

Now that we can filter and extract data from the catalog.json, we need the capability to *build* the catalog.json from the available data and metadata files in the sample data directory. The current catalog.json is manually built from the L1B filenames during processing. We also want to be able to trace all the processing from the original L1 files to the L3 files. This is one more step in that direction. We want to:

1) Identify the L1 files which belong to an 'observation.' Recall that ideally an observation is composed of 8 'science' files (2 each in the 656HIA, 632OI, 647NH3, and 620CH4) filters and three 'context' files (NIR685, GRN550, and BLU450). The 647NH3 files will be consecutive, so that can be a clue as to how to search for each observation. I have updated the data samples folder to include all the data and metadata files for 2025-01-16 and renamed it from '20250116UTk' to '20250116UT.'

2) Produce a code that creates the obskeys for 20250116UT and the affiliated science and context files. The obskeys should of course match those listed when running getAllBetweenDates(data, '2025-01-16','2025-01-16'), namely: ['20250116UTa', '20250116UTb', '20250116UTc', '20250116UTd', '20250116UTe', '20250116UTf', '20250116UTg', '20250116UTh', '20250116UTi', '20250116UTj', '20250116UTk', '20250116UTl', '20250116UTm', '20250116UTn', '20250116UTo', '20250116UTp']

3) The output data structure should include the source L1 data files (all 11) associated with each obskey. It should be filterable by both datetime and by optical filter (656HIA, 632OI, 647NH3, 620CH4, NIR685, GRN550, and BLU450)

There are two clear follow on miniprojects that will need to be detailed. One will incorporate access to the contents of the L1 metadata files. The other will use the obskeys to create queries accessing specific information all the way from L1 to L3. At some point, we will need to create persistent storage forms (JSON and/or CSV) to ensure preservation of the metadata in case of loss of data and the need to recover it and also for analysis.
