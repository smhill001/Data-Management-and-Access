Project 6:

We now have the ability to index and access files at various stages of processing as well as the ability to turn *.png files into FITS files. The next step is to 'complete' those FITS files by adding all the necessary metadata. To do this we will need to access the metadata from the *.CameraSettings.txt files and append it to the FITS headers currently created by Process_L1X.py, before the files are written to disk. Key steps and considerations to do this are:

1) Read and parse the *.CameraSettings.txt file associated with each PNG file into a set of keyword-value pairs.
2) Add the keyword-value pairs to the FITS header generated by PlanetMapper in Process_L1X.py before the 'observation' is saved as a FITS file.
3) It turns out there is a method associated with 'observations' that allows you to do this without going to the astropy.io library. The method is:observation.append_to_header() and information on it can be found here: https://planetmapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/documentation.html#planetmapper.Observation.append_to_header. I added a line to Process_L1X.py to test this method and it seems to work. 
4) I'd suggest that we add the prefix phrase "HEIRARCH SHRPCAP " before our actual keywords, since we're taking the metadata generated by the SharpCap video capture program and simply passing them through.
5) Some of the SharpCap keywords are *very* long. I'm not sure if this will break the FITS format or PlanetMapper, but we'll have to find out. If length does break something, then we'll have to think about dropping keywords or coming up with abbreviated keywords.
