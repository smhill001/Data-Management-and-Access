Now that we can retrieve detailed data from the JSON catalog, the next step is to be able to search and find a subset of object keys that meet certain criteria. For instance (in order of increasing complexity):

1) Return a list of all object keys that use a given 'Telescope', e.g., 'C11'.
2) Return a list of all object keys where the datetime of the NH3file is between two specified datetimes.
3) Return a list of all object keys where the datetimes of the NH3file, CH4file, and RGBfile are between the two specified datetimes.

The most complex query would consist of a join of multiple criteria. However, this is getting close to real DB functionality. We should defer this until items 1-3 are complete. This may be the point at which we want to consider a real DB like Mongo.
